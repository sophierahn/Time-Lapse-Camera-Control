#This is the script that should take in a propsed schedule file
#Then check each line 
#Verify there are no empty lines and they are of the correct format
#if not of the correct format, it should exit and report which lines are
#an issue
#if of the correct format, it should export these dates into
#schedule.txt

#filling out the schedule may still be laborious, but there will be at
#least one check in place

#i can also consider changing the format to a friendlier format to type
